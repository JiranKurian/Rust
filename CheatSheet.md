# Rust CheatSheet

* Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.

## cargo
---

| Command                   | Function                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cargo --version`         | To check cargo version                                                                                                                                                       |
| `cargo new [projectname]` | It creates new directory with the given project name and initialize it with the necessary files. Cargo.toml file is generated by this command.                               |
| `cargo new -help`         | To get all available options                                                                                                                                                 |
| `cargo build`             | Used for compiling the Cargo Project                                                                                                                                         |

| `cargo check`             | The command quickly checks the code to make sure it compiles but doesn't produce an executable.                                                                              |
| `cargo build --release`   | The code will be compiled with optimizations. The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. |
| `cargo doc --open`        | This command will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser                                                               |


## Data types
---
* Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.
* In rust the default integer type is `i32`

| 64-bit  | `f64`  | -        | -      | `let y: f64 = 3.0;`  | Floating-Point Types |
| 1-byte  | -      | -        | `bool` |                      | Boolean Type         |
| 4-bytes | -      | -        | `char` |                      | Character Type       |

## Tips
---
* If you’re using more than one word in your filename, use an underscore to separate them. For example, use hello_world.rs rather than helloworld.rs.
* Using a `!` means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function.
* If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the “Hello, world!” project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the project code into the src directory and create an appropriate Cargo.toml file.
* Cargo stores the executables in the target/debug directory.
* Cargo stores the release executables in target/release instead of target/debug.
* If you’re benchmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run cargo build --release and benchmark with the executable in target/release.
* Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names.
* Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value.
* While loop is slower when it comes to dealing with collections, because the compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check on every element on every iteration through the loop. So use For loop in such cases.
